# Diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease Using Machine Learning
### 🏥 Predicting Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Risk with Data Science  

## 📌 Overview
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to diagnose CAD based on medical and clinical data.

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that:
- 📊 Analyzes patient data and risk factors.
- 🏥 Applies machine learning models for CAD prediction.
- 📈 Evaluates model performance and insights.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:janshimy/Diagnosing-Coronary-Artery-Disease.git
   cd Diagnosing-Coronary-Artery-Disease


## 📊 Data Description
The dataset includes various clinical features such as:

- Age, Sex, Cholesterol Levels
- Blood Pressure, Heart Rate
- ECG Results, Smoking Status
- Presence of Chest Pain
- Diabetes & Other Risk Factors
The goal is to predict the likelihood of CAD using these features.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
The notebook explores multiple models including: 
   ✔️ Logistic Regression
   ✔️ Random Forest Classifier
   ✔️ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   ✔️ Neural Networks (if applicable)

Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores.

## 📈 Results & Insights
Identifies key risk factors contributing to CAD.
Compares different models to find the best-performing one.
Provides interpretability for medical decision-making.
